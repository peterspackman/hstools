### Sarlacc

The aim of this project is to provide a simple interface
for a variety of computational techniques associated
with hirshfeld surface calculations and spherical harmonic
shape descriptors.

This project is written for Python 3, though due to its brevity
backporting to Python2.7 should not be too difficult.

Dependencies:

* click
* fastcluster
* h5py
* hdbscan
* matplotlib
* numpy
* periodictable
* plyfile
* progressive,
* scikit-image
* scikit-learn
* scipy

### Utils
